# Unhandled Firebase SDK Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase applications: the lack of proper error handling for network connectivity problems and authentication failures.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that doesn't handle Firebase errors, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem

Firebase operations like data persistence and authentication are asynchronous.  Without proper error handling, network issues or authentication failures can cause silent errors, making debugging difficult.  The user may encounter unexpected behavior without clear feedback.

## Solution

The solution involves adding `.catch()` blocks to all Firebase calls to handle potential errors.  These handlers should inform the user appropriately and take steps to recover or gracefully handle the error, providing a better user experience.

## Setup

1. Install the Firebase JavaScript SDK: `npm install firebase`
2. Configure your Firebase project and obtain API keys.
3. Replace the placeholder values in `bugSolution.js` with your Firebase configuration.
