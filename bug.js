The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the user's device is offline or has poor network connectivity.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your app if not properly handled.  Specifically, asynchronous operations like `set()`, `get()`, or `update()` may fail silently or throw errors that are not easily caught. For example, a `set()` call might appear to succeed but not actually write the data to the database if the network connection is lost during the operation.  Another common issue is the lack of proper error handling for Firebase authentication methods.  If there's a problem with the user's credentials or network connection, authentication can fail without giving clear indication to the user or developer.

```javascript
// Problematic code - no error handling
db.ref('users/' + userId).set(userData);
```
